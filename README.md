# GoStack - Backend with NodeJS

This repository was developed during the nodejs classes at level 1 of Rocketseat GoStack where we created an api using Nodejs.

## Installation

You will need to have only <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> installed on your machine, and after that, clone this repository:

``$ git clone https://github.com/Mikael-Josias/GoStack_level1_NodeJS.git``


In this project i will use the API client <a href="https://insomnia.rest">Imsonia</a> to test the nodejs project. You can use whatever you think best.

<h4>Now just make a good code!</h4>
